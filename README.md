# tech-blog

## Description

- As an employ to a small start up company, the manager approached me to develop an a company blog for tech related issues.
- after developing the frame work and necessary boiler pot files and code I started with ironing out my models. From there I moved to frame working my potential handlebar pages and then my routes. After writing code to at least test connection to the server I ran into a fatal error for deploying to the local host. as a result I'll be reaching out to my peers about this issue
- Some key take away lessons was the the importance of syntax in the models as a single small error resulted in the entire server failing. another key take away the the importance of server setup, as having the sequelize sync at the wrong value will result on empty arrays.
